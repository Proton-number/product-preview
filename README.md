## My process
It didn't reall take so long in building this project. It shows how far i've come with frontend development and i'm super proud of that! I had little issues with adjusting to use Material Ui tags instead of regular html5 tags. Overall it was a good experience.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Material Ui


### What I learned
I learnt new ways to align items on a webpage, adding colors with createTheme and ThemeProvider. Took a while to grab to be honest ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. After a few articles, i got my way around it. Use Microsoft's color picker too to get colors of each element easily.


### Continued development
In future projects, i plan to learn alot more on react and get better with each new project. Build my new projects with Material-Ui and implement framer-motion too. I want to learn to write less css code and to make responsive webpages and smoother UI.
